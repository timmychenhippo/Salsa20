Salsa20 Encryption for MAVLink on ArduPilot
This project implements the Salsa20 encryption algorithm and applies it to encrypt MAVLink communication in the ArduPilot system. The project includes a test file (test.cpp) that simulates the encryption process with a sample MAVLink message.

Project Overview
Salsa20 Algorithm: A fast and secure stream cipher used for encrypting and decrypting MAVLink communication data.
MAVLink Data Simulation: test.cpp simulates a MAVLink message and demonstrates the application and effect of Salsa20 encryption.
